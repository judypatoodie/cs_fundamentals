1. Pseudo-code the following algorithms:
   A:
   - Making Coffee:
     FUNCTION makeCoffee(coffee)
       IF coffee = whole beans
          THEN grind coffee to coffee grounds
       END IF
       GET kettle
       TURN faucet ON
       ADD water to kettle to boil
       GET table spoon
       GET coffee filter
       ADD 2 table spoons of coffee grounds to coffee filter
       GET string
       TIE top of filter with string
       GET clean mug
       ADD filter to clean mug
       WHILE water in mug is not full
          ADD boiled water in mug
       END WHILE
       IF strong coffee preference is true
          WAIT 4-5 mins
          REMOVE coffee filter from mug
       ELSE
          WAIT 3-4 mins
          REMOVE coffee filter from mug
       END IF
       SERVE mug of coffee
     END FUNCTION

     - Washing Dishes:
       FUNCTION washDishes
          IF sink contains dirty dishes
            TURN sink faucet ON
            GET soap and sponge
            ADD soap on sponge
            WHILE sink contains dirty dishes
              SCRUB dishes
              RINSE dishes
              PLACE clean dishes on drying rack
            END WHILE
            WASH hands
            TURN water OFF
          END IF
        END FUNCTION

      - Doing Laundry:
        FUNCTION doLaundry
          IF basket contains dirty clothes && basket is full
             PUT dirty clothes in washing machine
             GET detergent
             POUR 1 cup of detergent in washing machine
             SET washing machine to normal settings
             CLICK start on washing machine
             WHILE washing machine's red light is on
                WAIT
             END WHILE
             IF washing machine's green light is on
                THEN laundry is done washing
                TAKEOUT laundry from washing machine
                PUT laundry in dryer
                SET dryer to normal
                CLICK start on dryer
             END IF
             WHILE dryer's red light is on
                WAIT
             END WHILE
             IF dryer's green light is on
                TAKEOUT laundry
                FOLD laundry
                PUT laundry in drawers
             END IF
          END IF
        END FUNCTION


2. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful
   A:
   - Hotel Tonight: created search algorithm to find available hotels in a
     specified location sorted by most affordable.
   - Zendesk: created smooth integration between emails and many other
     applications via their API's to sync with a ticketing platform
     with built in analytics. The built in analytics allows support staff to
     monitor, forecast, and allocate work efforts based on their ticket trends.
   - Venmo: enabled quick payments to anyone, no matter what bank you have.

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an
   inefficient algorithm.
   A: A good algorithm must be fast and accurate. It must be space efficient-
      only utilizing space that it needs. It should be as simple as possible.
      It should display the correct results.
