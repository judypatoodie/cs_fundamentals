Short Answer
	1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
     A:
     Checking a stack of papers to see which paper is mine. I would check from
     the first paper on the stack and sequentially move to the next paper until
     I reach a paper that has my name on it.

	2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
     A:
     Finding a contact in your iPhone's contact book. Contacts are sorted
     alphabetically, you can start in the middle and break it up accordingly to
     find whether your contact is in the upper or lower range of your contact book.

	3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations
     would it take to find the value G using linear search?
     A:
     It will take 7 iterations since G is in the 6th index.

	4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations
     would it take to find the value G using binary search?
     A: It would take 3 iterations to find `G` through a binary search because
     the first iteration, mid will equal 4, the second iteration will equal 5,
     the 3rd iteration will equal 6, which is the index of `G`.

	5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
     choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
     A:
     I would use a linear search because the items are unsorted.
	6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
     choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
     A:
     I would use binary search because the list is sorted and it is faster in
     performance. Binary search uses a divide and conquer technique with sorted
     items which narrows down the results quicker than linear search which goes
     through each item sequentially from the beginning.

Programming Assignment:
	1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross"
     in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
     A:
     var dictionary= ["apple", "albatross", "laptop", "telephone", "aromatherapy", "whiteboard"];

     function binarySearch(arr, val) {
       let left = 0;
       let right = arr.length - 1;

       while (left <= right) {
         const mid = Math.round((right - left) / 2) + left;
         if (arr[mid] < val.toLowerCase()) {
            left = mid + 1;
         } else  if (arr[mid] > val.toLowerCase()) {
            right = mid - 1;
         }else{
            return `${arr[mid]} is the ${mid + 1}rd word in the list.`;
         }
       }
       return `${val} is not in the list.`;
     }

     console.log(binarySearch(dictionary, "Whiteboard"));


	2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-
     spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you
     net the right fish.
     A:
     var fishTank= ["beta fish", "goldfish", "baby shark", "mommy shark", "daddy shark",
     "blue fish", "white-spotted goldfish"];
     function findFish(fishArray, target){
       for(var i = 0; i<fishArray.length; i++){
         if (fishArray[i] === target.toLowerCase()) {
           return `I found the ${fishArray[i]} in the tank.`
         }
       }
       return  `The ${target} is not in the tank.`;
     }

     console.log(findFish(fishTank, "White-spotted goldFish"));
