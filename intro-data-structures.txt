Exercises

1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.

      a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]

         A: var peopleInLine=  ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

      b)Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you
        should insert Mary after Mike.

        A: peopleInLine.push("Mary");

      c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array.

        A: peopleInLine.findIndex(person => person =="Josh")

      d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find
         the item in the array?

        A:
           function findPerson(arr, personsName){
              if(arr.includes(personsName)){
                return personsName + " exists in array"
                }
                return personsName + " is not in the array"
              }

            console.log(findPerson(peopleInLine, 'Emily'))

      e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you
         code this so Melissa appears before Ava?

         A:
           peopleInLine.splice(1, 0, "Melissa");

           console.log(peopleInLine)

      f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

        A:

          function removeFromArr(array, element) {
          return array.filter(e => e !== element);
          };

          console.log(removeFrmArr(peopleInLine, "Patrick"));

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

  A: Fruits in a basket.
     - Array input for fruits ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Mango", "Peach"]
     - The basket contains fruits, represented as strings.
     - Fruits are in no alphabetical order
     - When someone eats a fruit, the fruit is removed from the basket.
     - Fruits can be added to the basket

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

  A: Developers can access my data structure by accessing the names of strings of fruit names in the
     array. Developers can manipulate the data by adding and removing fruits (string elements) in the basket (array).
