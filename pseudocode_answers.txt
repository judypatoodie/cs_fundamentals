Short Answer

> Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Programmers use pseudocode to help them develop algorithms. This is apart of the
brainstorming phase where they would first
 write out all steps required in the algorithm in a human readable form.

> If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

 A: You would get a bunch of errors and it won't work since it is in
 human readable form, not in a computer language.

 ####Programming Assignment

 > Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

 A:

 INPUT first number
 INPUT second number
 IF first number is greater than the second number
    PRINT first number
 ELSE
  PRINT second number
 END IF

>Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

 A:


INIT number equals 1
 WHILE number is not greater than 100
    ADD 1 to number
    RETURN number
 END WHILE
```

 >Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

 A:


 INPUT phonebook data to phoneDB
 INPUT search string
 FIND search string in phoneDB where search string equals phoneDB name property
 FIND search string in phoneDB where search string equals phoneDB phone property
 RETURN matching search string(s) in phonebook data


 >Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

 A:

 var phoneDB = [
     {
     name: "John",
     phone: "650-987-2314"
     },
     {
     name: "Julie",
     phone: "650-9123-7654"
     }
 ];

 function findMatch(searchString, myArray){
   var searchName= myArray.filter(hey => hey.name === searchString || hey.phone ===searchString );


   return searchName;

 }

 console.log(findMatch('650-987-2314', phoneDB));
